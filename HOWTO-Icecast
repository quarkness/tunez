Howto configure Tunez with Icecast:

0.  Make sure you setup Tunez first with instructions in the INSTALL
document.  Then procede here when it tells you.

1.  Ensure that the following libraries are installed (including the
development packages if you aren't compiling from source):
    
    libxml2
    libxslt
    libvorbis
    libogg
    libperl
    libshoutcast

2.  Download Icecast version 2.0 from http://www.icecast.org
3.  Untar Icecast in a directory of your choice and follow the installation
instructions included.  You will need to copy the icecast example
configuration file and tweak it for your needs.  The encoding password you
choose for your Icecast server must be identical to the password you will
store in the ices.conf file later.
4.  Download ices v0.3 from http://www.icecast.org/ices.php
5.  Ensure that after running the ./configure script you have something that
looks like this:

Features:
  XML     : yes
  Python  : no
  Perl    : yes
  LAME    : yes
  Vorbis  : yes

(having perl support is paramount here)
You'll need the libperl-dev package.

6.  Run make and make install for ices.
7.  Copy conf/ices.conf.dist from the ices tarball into your base Tunez
directory and rename it to ices.conf
8.  Edit ices.conf in your Tunez directory and make the following changes:

    8a.  In the playlist section:
        <!-- One of builtin, perl, or python. -->
            <Type>perl</Type>
            
    8b.  In the stream section, make sure you modify the hostname, port, and
    password to match the configuration on the icecast server you're streaming
    to.  (don't use hackme or letmein as your password).  Also feel free to
    change around the other stuff like name of your stream, etc.

9.  *** EDIT ices.pm in your Tunez directory and enter the mySQL
username/password/hostname/database.  ***

10.  Try starting it manually by running ices from within your
Tunez base directory (the one with ices.pm and ices.conf).  You must run it
within this directory.  Fire up your favorite audio player and insure that you
can hear the stream.

11.  Once you know that ices is working fine from the command line make sure
that Tunez can start/stop it with start/stop daemon.
