This is the PATCHING file.  It explains how to go about upgrading your version
of Tunez to the latest one without reinstalling a lot of things.

## Instructions on how to patch an existing copy of Tunez
###

In order to patch your working copy of Tunez you must follow the below steps.
If you're unsure about how to do this we highly recommend you manually upgrade
my moving files around.

1.  Make a backup of your Tunez HTML directory and your Tunez base directory
just in case.

2.  If you have Apache configured to automatically use the html/ folder in
your Tunez directory to be the HTTPROOT you don't need to bother doing the
next step and can skip to step 5.

***NOTE*** You most likely copied or moved the html/ directory out of the way
into your Apache HTTPROOT directory when you installed and need to procede to
step 3.

3.  Remove the old html/ directory in your Tunez directory if you left it
there during the first install.  rm -fr html/

4.  Use "ln -s" to create a symbolic link from your Tunez HTML directory which
Apache is outputting to html/ in your Tunez folder.

ln -s /var/www /usr/local/tunez/html

(for example with /var/www as your Tunez HTML folder being displayed by Apache
and /usr/local/tunez/html as the new target within wherever you keep the Tunez
files)

5.  Copy the patch file into your Tunez directory and cd into that directory.

6.  Run 'zcat file.patch.gz | patch -p1'

7.  You're all set, it should say all the patch files applied cleanly.  If
something went wrong restore from your backups and let us know what happened.
