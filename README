   Tunez, a web-based mp3 jukebox
   ------------------------------

Tunez in an mp3/ogg jukebox that works with a voting system that users access
through a web interface.  Each registered user can vote for the tracks he
wants and the Tunez daemon will take care of playing the most popular songs
either locally (through a soundcard) or through a streaming server, depending
on the setup.

The web interface is written entirely in php.  You have a choice between using
perl or php daemons for the daemon.

For help on how to install Tunez, please read the INSTALL file.
