TODO & BUGS:

Near Future:

- More icons especially for up/down sorting of search results
- Prevent tunezd from starting multiple times (use a lockfile)
- Merge Ben's volume thing for main page?
- Centralized config file (config.inc.php).  Find a way to source this file
    with Perl.
- Stop relying on mysql PASSWORD() function for hashing (because it sucks!)

Future:

- Add advertisement support
- Finish 'banked' voting mode implementation
- Text 2 Speech
- Make a pretty looking page for "permission denied"
- Make sure permissions on admin-type pages are checked for
- Show number of votes per song in playlist
- Examine alternatives to reloading the entire page after doing something very
  simple.  Perhaps just loading a new void page and not updating or
  doing it with Javascript..? (cclausen)
- A way to allow a "Representative" to vote on your behalf (ideally this would
  be glued together from the random code).  When a user logs in if they so
  specified an "Agent" could be instructed to vote on their behalf based on
  what they have voted for before. (lowman)
- Enhance Amazon.com guessing support...
- Recode history.php so it displays who played the song when... (also to
  charts.php).  In general make the output nicer.
- Also allow uploading of pictures from upload.php?
- Add uploaded_timestamp field to songs table to show when song was uploaded
- Add some way to normalize songs...?
- Add support for directly modifying the playlist in "dictator mode"
- Implement FULLTEXT searches
