.TH detach 1
.SH NAME
detach \- start process detached from terminal
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B detach
[ \fIcommand args\fR ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.PN detach
command
is a grungy little program for executing programs in the
background, without use of a control terminal. (In the style
of most common daemon processes...) The intent was to create a
program one could start via rsh, to initiate xterm sessions,
without keeping extra local rsh & remote rshd and shell processes
alive.
