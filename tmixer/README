smixer is a command-line and scriptable program to control and display
the mixer volume levels on a sound card in linux (might work in other OSS
supported OS's but I haven't tried any). smixer is ideal for setting
mixer settings on startup or to switch between multiple configurations
quickly.

Distrubution of smixer is under the GNU GPL. See the "COPYING" and/or
smixer.c file for more information.

Usage is explained in the man page.
